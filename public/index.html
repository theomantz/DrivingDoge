      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        The meteoric rise of Dogecoin during the early months of 2021 investors of all types puzzled. How could such a objectively pointless asset, a meme currency, acheive a reasonable value? The desire to uncover, what drives the price of Doge, and other assets gave rise to this project.

        What is attempted here is sentiment analysis of recent Reddit posts, relevant to each asset found using the site's own search engine. 

        The backend is a basic NodeJS server, which performs sentiment analysis using a TensorFlow ML Model trained on IMDB movie ratings.
